          is the first production by artist collective <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>[Say Nothing and Leave]</span>{' '}
          to be made available to the general public. Born in the seedy underbelly of the Bay Area's underground
          immersive theater scene (which is a real thing), Change Your Mind offers a rare opportunity to witness the
          gritty, transgressive performance style that is unique to San Francisco. We are proud to be located on Haight
          St., the spiritual home of our preferred style of radical and unusual "art."

          This immersive performance explores themes of identity, consciousness, and mental health, and it is not subtle
          about any of these. Participants are subjected to psychologically intense stimuli and difficult choices. No
          matter which choice they make, they will certainly{' '}

        <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginTop: 3 }}>
          Change Your Mind includes 1-1 interactions between participants and performers, binaural audio, 1-way mirrors,
          deep faked video, personality exams, flashing lights, unscripted moments, branching narrative, and, in one
          scene, all of these simultaneously. The result is heartbreaking, intense, and ultimately, uplifting.
